## About Permissions for Android
[Runtime permissions](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html) beginning in Android 6.0 (API level 23), users grant permissions to apps while the app is running, not when they install the app. This approach streamlines the app install process, since the user does not need to grant permissions when they install or update the app. It also gives the user more control over the app's functionality; for example, a user could choose to give a camera app access to the camera but not to the device location. The user can revoke the permissions at any time, by going to the app's Settings screen.

Permissions is a library to make all easier permissions calls on Android.
> This library use [Dexter library](https://github.com/Karumi/Dexter) under the hood.


## How to
**Step 1.** Add the JitPack repository to your build file
```gradle
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
		}
	}
```

**Step 2.** Add the dependency
```gradle
dependencies {
		compile 'com.github.jgabrielfreitas:Permissions:1.1.0'
}
```

## Usage

> Check the `app` module for a sample

#### First of all
In your `Application` extends `CorePermissionsApplication` to initialize [Dexter library](https://github.com/Karumi/Dexter)

```java
public class CustomApplication extends CorePermissionsApplication {
	/*
	 * the only thing this class does is call Dexter.initialize(context); in onCreate
	 */
}
```

#### In your `.java` implements `OnPermissionRequest`
Your class will implement the following methods:

+ `onPermissionAllowed()` - Permission allowed, be happy :grimacing:
+ `onPermissionDenied()` - Permission denied, this is not good :fire:
+ `onPermissionDeniedButAskAgain(PermissionToken token)` - The user don't allow your request permission, but you can ask again using `token.continuePermissionRequest();` until they click `never ask again`

#### Request Permission

A location example


```java

// create a PermissionManager passing a Context and a OnPermissionRequest
LocationPermissionManager locationPermissionManager = new LocationPermissionManager(this, this);

// here, you request user location permission
locationPermissionManager.requestPermission();

```

The Dialog asking permission appears at this moment and you'll be called back when user tap at **DENY** or **ALLOW**.
